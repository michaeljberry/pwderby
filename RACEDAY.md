## Setup
It's important to go through the setup steps to ensure a fun and exhilarating derby experience.

### Navigate to Setup
#### Add Racer
You can add racers to your roster in bulk or individually. To add them individually, navigate to the Check-in page. To add them in bulk, navigate to the "Import Racers" page and complete and upload accompanying "import_racers" spreadsheet.

If racers come later, don't sweat! You can add a racer later, even after you've begun racing and you'll be prompted how you'd like to integrate the new racer into the future heats.

##### Racer Check-in
You have the option to add a "New Racer". Enter the first and last name of the racer, the car name and the associated group that the racer belongs to. The car number will be determined automatically based on the racer's group and the next available car number. If you would like to display where the racer is from, enter this in the "From" field. Be sure to mark the racer as Trophy eligible, if the racer is eligible to receive an award at the end of the derby.

##### Car Check-in
Each racer should have at least one car to race. A racer may have more than one car though. 

#### Setup your racing groups
When adding or editing a racer, you can add a new group. Or you can also add a group from the Settings page or while creating an award. The group determines the car number, heats, and awards.

*By default, rounds will include only racers within the same group. To change this, enable the "Interleave heats from different groups" option. You can now recreate the rounds schedules.*

#### Timer

#### Add awards
There are three types of awards: trophy, certificate, verbal. When you add the awards, give them a name, select their type and category and assign them to a group.

#### Remaining settings
If you do not have a timer, it's best to enable "Race by place (points) instead of time". This will allow manual entry of placement after each race.

## Racing
### Scheduling
A heat is a single race. A round consists of multiple heats. A round needs to be scheduled before it can be raced.

Once you have at least two racers and their cars checked in and you're ready to race, go to the race dashboard. On the dashboard, you'll see the inital rounds for each group. You can make adjustments to the rounds, or you can make adjustments to the racing method used to suggest how the rounds are created.

When you're ready to begin a round, select a round and click "Schedule". When you're asked how many times each car should appear in each lane, make a selection. Then start the round!

### Recording the results
If you have previously connected a timer, it should record the heat times and places for each car. If you're entering the places manually, click "Manual Results". Then select the placement for each car. Once entered, click "Save".

### Completed Round
Once a round is complete, you can end the race or begin another round. To begin another round, click "Add New Round". To finish the race, click "Finish".
